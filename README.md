# Blinds-Partner (Visually Impaired Individuals)

## Project Description
This **smart assistive stick** was developed for the **Nation-Level CBSE Science Exhibition** in 2018-19 with the aim of helping visually impaired individuals navigate their surroundings safely and independently. The stick incorporates various sensors to detect obstacles, water, and light conditions, providing real-time feedback to the user to prevent accidents. Additionally, the system includes a glove equipped with a SONAR sensor that aids in navigation. Power banks are used to supply portable power, ensuring the device operates continuously throughout the day.

## Features
- **Obstacle Detection (SONAR on Stick & Glove):**  
  A SONAR sensor emits ultrasonic waves to detect obstacles by measuring the reflected signal, helping users avoid collisions.

- **Stick Locator (IR Sensor):**  
  The IR sensor system helps the user locate the stick if misplaced. A buzzer is triggered when the IR signal is detected, making the stick easier to find.

- **Low Light Visibility (LDR Sensor & LEDs):**  
  An LDR sensor controls LEDs, which glow in low-light conditions, ensuring the user is visible to others in dim environments for enhanced safety.

- **Water Detection (Electrodes & Motor):**  
  Two electrodes at the base of the stick detect water by completing a circuit. When water is detected, a motor activates to alert the user, preventing slips in wet areas.

- **Additional Safety (Flame Sensor):**  
  A flame sensor adds extra safety by detecting fire hazards and alerting the user.

- **Portable Power (Power Banks):**  
  Power banks supply consistent power to the system, enabling uninterrupted usage over extended periods without the need for constant recharging.
